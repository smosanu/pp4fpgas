9/6/2018 note by smosanu:
I wanted to read this book on my Kindle device, so I imported this project in Overleaf and changed two lines in main.tex file:
- \documentclass[12pt]{book}
- \geometry{a5paper, margin=0.5in}

To further increase the text, I switched to a6paper and adjusted a bunch of figures to fit.

Re-compiled and worked like a charm! Thank you very much to the authors!
